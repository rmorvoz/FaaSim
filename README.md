# FaaSim

Python event-driven simulator for cloud/edge serverless platforms

This simulator was created for academic and research purposes. This is an experimental version and its completeness and correctness are not guaranteed.

The input parameters of the simulator are hard-coded.

The simulator works with an input file, called event_list.txt which includes a time-ordered list of events.

Every entry of the event_list.txt includes:
 
 - The init time of each event
 
 - The edge zone where each event is generated
